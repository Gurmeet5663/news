# **Combustion Process of Solid Waste Materials and Effect of Key Parameters**

## **1. Introduction**

Combustion is a thermo-chemical process in which carbonaceous materials react with oxygen at elevated temperatures to produce heat energy, flue gases, and solid residues. In waste-to-energy (WtE) systems, combustion is widely used to recover energy from municipal solid waste components such as wood, paper, and plastics. The burning behavior of these materials differs due to variations in chemical composition, volatile content, moisture, and calorific value. During combustion, parameters such as temperature, gases evolved, heat release, char formation, and tar generation significantly influence combustion efficiency and environmental performance.

## **2. Combustion Process of Different Materials**

### **2.1 Combustion of Wood Material**

Wood is a natural biomass mainly composed of **cellulose (40–50%)**, **hemicellulose (20–30%)**, and **lignin (20–30%)**, with inherent moisture.

The combustion of wood occurs in **three main stages**:

1. **Drying Stage (up to ~150°C):**
   Free and bound moisture evaporates without heat release.

2. **Devolatilization / Pyrolysis Stage (200–500°C):**
   Organic compounds decompose to produce volatile gases, tar vapors, and solid char.

3. **Char Combustion Stage (above 500°C):**
   The remaining carbon-rich char reacts with oxygen to produce CO₂ and heat.

Wood combustion produces moderate flame intensity, relatively high char content, and lower emissions compared to plastics.

### **2.2 Combustion of Paper**

Paper is derived from wood pulp and mainly consists of **cellulose**, with very low lignin and moisture content.

The combustion process of paper is similar to wood but occurs more rapidly due to:

* Lower density
* Higher surface area
* Lower moisture content

Paper burns easily with **high volatile release**, producing:

* Short flaming phase
* Limited char residue

Because of its oxygen-rich structure, paper combustion is more complete and produces fewer toxic emissions compared to plastics.

### **2.3 Combustion of Plastics**

Plastics are synthetic polymers derived from petroleum and have very high calorific values.

#### **(a) Hard Plastics (e.g., HDPE, PVC, PET)**

Hard plastics undergo:

1. **Thermal softening and melting**
2. **Pyrolysis (300–600°C)** producing hydrocarbon vapors
3. **Gas-phase combustion**

Some plastics (e.g., PVC) release **HCl gas** and form toxic compounds if not properly controlled.

Hard plastics generally:

* Burn slowly
* Produce high heat
* Generate less char but more gaseous products

---

#### **(b) Single-Use Soft Plastics (e.g., LDPE, plastic bags)**

Soft plastics melt quickly and burn intensely once ignited. Their combustion is characterized by:

* Rapid volatilization
* Long luminous flames
* High soot and smoke formation

These plastics can drip while burning, increasing fire spread risks.

## **3. Effect of Key Parameters During Combustion**

### **3.1 Effect of Temperature**

Temperature is the most critical parameter affecting combustion efficiency.

* **Low temperature (<600°C):**

  * Incomplete combustion
  * High CO, tar, and soot formation
* **Optimum temperature (800–1000°C):**

  * Complete oxidation of volatiles
  * Maximum energy recovery
* **Very high temperature (>1100°C):**

  * Ash melting and slagging
  * Equipment damage

Plastics require higher temperatures for complete destruction compared to wood and paper.

---

### **3.2 Effect of Gases Evolved**

Different gases are released depending on material composition:

* **Wood and Paper:**

  * CO₂, CO, CH₄, H₂O vapor
* **Plastics:**

  * Hydrocarbons, CO, CO₂
  * Acid gases (HCl from PVC)
  * Toxic compounds if combustion is incomplete

Proper oxygen supply and gas residence time are essential to minimize harmful emissions.

---

### **3.3 Effect of Heat Release**

Heat release depends on calorific value:

* **Paper:** ~14–16 MJ/kg
* **Wood:** ~15–18 MJ/kg
* **Plastics:** ~30–45 MJ/kg

Plastics contribute significantly to energy generation in WtE plants, while wood and paper provide stable combustion and flame support.

---

### **3.4 Effect of Char Formation**

Char is the solid carbonaceous residue left after devolatilization.

* **Wood:** Produces significant char due to lignin content
* **Paper:** Produces minimal char
* **Plastics:** Almost no char formation

Char combustion is slower but contributes to sustained heat release and improves combustion stability.

---

### **3.5 Effect of Tar Formation**

Tar consists of heavy hydrocarbons formed during incomplete combustion.

* **High tar formation occurs at:**

  * Low temperatures
  * Insufficient oxygen
* **Wood:** Moderate tar production
* **Paper:** Low tar production
* **Plastics:** High tar and soot formation if poorly combusted

Excess tar can cause fouling of combustion equipment and increase emissions.

## **4. Conclusion**

The combustion behavior of wood, paper, and plastics varies significantly due to differences in physical and chemical properties. Wood and paper burn through drying, pyrolysis, and char oxidation stages, while plastics undergo melting and gas-phase combustion. Parameters such as temperature, gas composition, heat release, char, and tar formation strongly influence combustion efficiency and environmental impact. In waste-to-energy systems, maintaining optimal temperature, adequate oxygen supply, and proper gas residence time is essential for efficient energy recovery and emission control.
